# Personal Finance Tracker

This is a **Personal Finance Tracker** application built in Python. It allows you to manage your income and expenses, view financial summaries, and visualize your transactions over time. The program uses a CSV file to store transaction data and provides a user-friendly interface for adding transactions and analyzing your financial habits.

## Features

- **Add Transactions**: Record income or expenses with details like date, amount, category, and description.
- **View Transactions**: Filter and view transactions within a specific date range.
- **Financial Summary**: Calculate total income, total expenses, and net savings for a given period.
- **Visualizations**: Plot income and expenses over time using Matplotlib.

  - A list of transactions with date, amount, category, and description.
  - A summary of total income, total expenses, and net savings.
- You will also be asked if you want to see a plot of your income and expenses over time.

## Data Storage
- Transactions are stored in a CSV file named `finance_data.csv` in the project directory.
- The CSV file includes the following columns:
  - `date`: The transaction date.
  - `amount`: The transaction amount.
  - `category`: Either "Income" or "Expense".
  - `description`: Optional transaction details.
